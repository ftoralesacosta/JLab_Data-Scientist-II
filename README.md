Interview Problems for Data Scientist II position


## Problem 1:
Solve the inverted pendulum problem using reinforcement learning. The inverted pendulum swing-up problem is a classic problem in the control literature. In this version of the problem, the pendulum starts in a random position, and the goal is to swing it up so it stays upright.
To solve this problem, I implement the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm in a python class and provide a script that coordinates the interaction between the agent and the environment. 

I use the updated gymnasium package (fork of OpenAI's depricated gym package), and use the Pendulum-v1 environment for easy setup and reproducability.
